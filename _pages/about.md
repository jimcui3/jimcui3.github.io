Hello! Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student that joined the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) in June 2023, majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.engineering.uga.edu/phd-engineering/electrical-and-computer). I am fortunate to receive guidance from [Professor Yiping Zhao](https://www.zhao-nano-lab.com/) and [Doctor Xianyan Chen](https://www.stat.uga.edu/directory/people/xianyan-chen).

My work focuses on statistical and machine learning analysis of biological/chemical sensor data, especially on [SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy), an incredibly powerful technique that enables the detection and analysis of molecules at the nanoscale. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of novel diagnostic algorithms about identifying latent patterns of spectrum, classifying spectrum, and making generalizations with spectrum in all kinds of circumstances. I also hope to contribute to the fundamentals of this field, such as building open databases and designing Python packages that help researchers around the globe to get, process, and analyze spectrum data much more easily.

**$\leftarrow$ Please feel free to connect with me for any collaboration opportunities or discussions related to this fascinating field!**

I received my Master's degree in the [Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-ms/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in 2023. Previously, I received my undergraduate degree in 2017 from [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) with a B.S. in Statistics. At Nankai University, I was supervised by [Professor Sheng Zhang](http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/2015/1112/c4059a32165/page.htm) to write my thesis: An Exploration of Transformer-Based Object Detection Technology.

**Check out the publications page! I recently published my first paper (though not as first author)!**

* This webpage is still under construction! I'll add more things to it in the future.
