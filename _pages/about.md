Hello! Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student who joined [the University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) in June 2023, majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.engineering.uga.edu/phd-engineering/electrical-and-computer). I am fortunate to receive guidance from [Dr. Yiping Zhao](https://www.zhao-nano-lab.com/) and [Dr. Xianyan Chen](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/xianyan-chen/).

My work focuses on statistical and machine learning analysis of biological/chemical sensor data, especially on [SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy), an incredibly powerful technique that enables the detection and analysis of molecules at the nanoscale. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of novel diagnostic algorithms for identifying latent patterns of spectrum, classifying spectrum, and making generalizations with spectrum in all kinds of circumstances, e.g., virus detection. I also hope to contribute to the fundamentals of this field, such as building open databases and designing Python packages that help researchers around the globe get, process, and analyze spectrum data much more easily.

I received my Master's degree in the [Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-ms/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in 2023. Previously, I received my undergraduate degree in 2021 from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) with a B.S. in Statistics. At Nankai University, I was supervised by [Dr. Sheng Zhang](http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/2015/1112/c4059a32165/page.htm) to write my thesis: An Exploration of Transformer-Based Object Detection Technology.
